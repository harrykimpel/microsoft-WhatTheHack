# What The Hack - Agent Framework Observability with New Relic

## Introduction

This hands-on set of challenges will teach participants how to build production-ready AI agents using Microsoft Agent Framework with comprehensive observability through OpenTelemetry and New Relic.

Welcome to WanderAI, a startup building intelligent travel planning agents! In this hack, you'll help WanderAI evolve from a basic prototype to a production-ready AI agent platform with enterprise-grade observability and security.

This hack assumes you have a basic understanding of:
- Python programming
- REST APIs and web applications
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents
- Basic observability concepts (logs, metrics, traces)

## Learning Objectives

Through the WanderAI journey, participants will learn to:
- Build AI agents using Microsoft Agent Framework with tool calling capabilities
- Instrument applications with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- Integrate New Relic for comprehensive observability and monitoring
- Implement LLM-based evaluation and quality gates
- **Detect and prevent prompt injection attacks (Challenge 07)**
- Create custom dashboards and alerts for AI agent systems
- Apply security best practices for production AI applications

## The WanderAI Story

WanderAI is a travel planning startup that helps users create personalized itineraries. Your team will build and enhance their AI agent platform through seven challenges:

1. **Getting Started** - Set up the development environment
2. **Agent Framework Basics** - Build your first AI agent
3. **Building the MVP** - Create the WanderAI travel planning agent
4. **Adding Observability** - Instrument with OpenTelemetry
5. **New Relic Integration** - Connect to New Relic for monitoring
6. **Monitoring & Dashboards** - Create custom dashboards and alerts
7. **Quality Gates** - Implement LLM evaluation and quality checks
8. **Security** - Detect and prevent prompt injection attacks
