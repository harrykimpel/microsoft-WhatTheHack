# What The Hack - Agent Framework Observability with New Relic

## Introduction

Welcome to this hack focused on the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview) — an open-source development kit designed to empower developers to build robust AI agents and sophisticated multi-agent workflows in both .NET and Python. By unifying and extending the best ideas from the [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) and [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) projects, the Microsoft Agent Framework provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of AI-driven applications.

In this hack, you’ll learn how to observe and monitor these AI agents using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), with [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) as the telemetry backend. This integration enables you to gain deep insights into agent behavior, performance, and reliability—helping you build smarter, more resilient AI solutions. Let’s dive in and unlock the full potential of AI agents with world-class observability!

## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will be building your first agent-based application in Python and learn how to use different tools for different tasks.

1. Understand the core concepts of the Microsoft Agent Framework and its role in building AI agents and multi-agent workflows.
2. Build and run a simple agent-based application in Python using the Microsoft Agent Framework.
3. Instrument AI agents with OpenTelemetry to capture traces, metrics and logs.
4. Integrate New Relic as a telemetry backend to visualize and analyze agent observability data.
5. Explore best practices for monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing AI-driven applications.
6. Build a basic evaluation-driven quality gate for generative AI in a CI/CD environment.
