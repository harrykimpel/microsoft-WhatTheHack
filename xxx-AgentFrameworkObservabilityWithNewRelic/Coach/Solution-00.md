## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: GitHub Codespaces Not Starting

**Symptom:** Codespace hangs on "Setting up your codespace" or fails to load
**Cause:** Browser extensions, network issues, or account permissions
**Solution:**

- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Verify GitHub account has Codespaces enabled
- Check [GitHub Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/) for outages

### Issue 2: GitHub Copilot Not Working

**Symptom:** No suggestions appearing, or "Copilot is not available" message
**Cause:** Extension not installed, not signed in, or subscription expired
**Solution:**

- Verify Copilot extension is installed in VS Code
- Sign out and sign back into GitHub in VS Code
- Check subscription status at github.com/settings/copilot
- Restart VS Code after installation

### Issue 3: VS Code Extensions Not Installing

**Symptom:** Extensions fail to install or show errors
**Cause:** Network restrictions, proxy settings, or corrupted cache
**Solution:**

- Check network connectivity
- Try installing from VS Code Marketplace website
- Clear VS Code extension cache: `~/.vscode/extensions`
- Restart VS Code

### Issue 4: Environment Variables Not Set

**Symptom:** API calls fail with authentication errors
**Cause:** `.env` file missing or not loaded
**Solution:**

- Verify `.env` file exists in project root
- Check variable names match expected format
- Restart terminal/Codespace after changes
- Use `echo $VARIABLE_NAME` to verify values

## What Participants Struggle With

- **Understanding Codespaces:** Help them understand it's a cloud-hosted VS Code environment with all tools pre-installed
- **API Key Setup:** Guide them through obtaining and setting GitHub token and New Relic license key
- **Environment Variables:** Watch for participants putting keys directly in code instead of `.env` file
- **Git/GitHub Basics:** Some may need help with basic git commands and GitHub navigation

**Minimum Viable:** 15 minutes (for experienced developers with existing accounts)
**Stretch Goals:** +15 minutes (for those needing to create new accounts or troubleshoot)
